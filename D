Hi,

Really sorry for bothering, 

Actually, I got the billable opportunity in the account that I'm currently working related to my skill set, because of that only I'm expecting shrink from this reservation.

They are asking to get release asap to schedule client discussion, being a fresher I don't want to lose this opportunity., I understood it happens as per the process

Can you please tell me when can I expect release /confirmation from your side.




Hi Sir,

Last week I asked prodosh 


I got one opportunity in cisco

yesterday prodosh refered me for one project  in cisco
and i had interview yesterday and also I was selected

so they said i had to attend client interview for further process, for  that  they want to reserve me in tat proj


Bt last week i got a mail that i was reserved for one proj in other acccount..


that was happened automaticall, because i was in virtual pool for 1 week right, 

when i ask that reserved manager, he says,that he needs client confirmation to relase me from reservation,

here in cisco, they are saying, try to get realse as soon as possible, so tht they will reserve me in here and i can go for
client interview.




Currently I was reserved to some other project in another account,
