Priority Queue
	- it is like the normal queue , but every elemnt has
	priotity,
	- element with high priority is dequeued first before
	element with low priority..
	- if two elements has same priority, then its dequeued in the order of queue..

	Methods:
		isEmpty(), insert(), findMax(), remove()

Max priority queue & Min Priority Queue

_____________________________________

Heap 
	- it is the specaial case of balanced binary tree
	where root node is compared  with  children and arranged accordingly..

	Min-Heap - value of root node is less thn or eql to chhildrn  nodes

	Max-Heap - value of root node is greater than  childeren nodes

_____________

Threaded binary tree
	in order to avoid using null at the leaf node, linking it  to the some other node is threaded binary tree

	Threaded Binary Tree is also a binary tree in which all left child pointers that are NULL (in Linked list representation) points to its in-order predecessor, and all right child pointers that are NULL (in Linked list representation) points to its in-order successor.

_________________

spannig tree
	- it is the subgraph of a unidirected where all the vertices will have minimum no of edges ,without missing any vertices

Minimu Spanning tree
	- sum of weight of edges should be minimum..

TO find minimusm spanning tree,
	we can is 1.) Prim's algorithm
			  2.) Kruskal algorithm

		------------

		AVL Insertion Process
If there is an imbalance in left child of left subtree, then you perform a right rotation.
 If there is an imbalance in right child of right subtree, then you perform a left rotation.
  If there is an imbalance in right child of left subtree, then you perform a right-left rotation.
