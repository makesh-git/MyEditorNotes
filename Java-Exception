****************************


Throws - telling compiler these exception may occur,so you are suppressing those errors
Throw - to call exception explicitly, forcing to throw the errors



# try cant't be alone , either it folloed by catch OR finally OR both


# try with resource - no need of finnaly to close the resource, it will automaticlay close when it comes out of scope


# if you put catch exception first nd followed by other type exception	
	-unreachable catch block because it is already handled by other catch( that of type exception)
	
# Create Own exception
 - create a class that extends exception , overide super method with the message that you want to print
